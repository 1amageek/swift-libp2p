warning: 'swift-swim': Conflicting identity for swift-nio-udp: dependency 'github.com/1amageek/swift-nio-udp' and dependency '/users/1amageek/desktop/swift-nio-udp' both point to the same package identity 'swift-nio-udp'. The dependencies are introduced through the following chains: (A) /users/1amageek/desktop/swift-libp2p->/users/1amageek/desktop/swift-swim->github.com/1amageek/swift-nio-udp (B) /users/1amageek/desktop/swift-libp2p->/users/1amageek/desktop/swift-nio-udp. If there are multiple chains that lead to the same dependency, only the first chain is shown here. To see all chains use debug output option. To resolve the conflict, coordinate with the maintainer of the package that introduces the conflicting dependency. This will be escalated to an error in future versions of SwiftPM.
